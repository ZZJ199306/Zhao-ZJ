Application of ring coupled double-Duffing oscillator to the scheme for identifying Coulter signal under low SNR
The key technology to improve the accuracy of Coulter counter is to effectively measure the pulse signals annihilated in noise, 
that is, under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNRâ‰¤0). In this paper, the chaotic oscillator in nonlinear dynamical system is proposed for 
the first time to identify simulated Coulter signal under low SNR. The continuous synchronous mutation (CSM) phenomenon of the 
chaotic ring coupled double-Duffing (RCDD) oscillator is proposed to identify the Gaussian pulse signal annihilated in white Gaussian noise. 
The maximum difference between the two state variables when the RCDD oscillator has the CSM phenomenon can be used as the eigenvalue to 
determine the anti-noise ability of system, and the identification function of pulse amplitude is constructed. In a good identification state, 
the minimum SNR of identification function can identify pulse amplitude is -13.68dB. Matlab/Simulink module is used to verify that 
the proposed method can be used to identify simulated Coulter signal amplitude under low SNR, which provides an approach for developing technology 
of measuring pulse signals in the 
self-developed Coulter counter.
